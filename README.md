# 🚲 Wingman - Ride Analytics dbt Project

This repository contains a modular and testable dbt project for analyzing ride participation data using Google BigQuery. It is designed following best practices for the modern data stack — including dimensional modeling, data quality testing, and scalable fact/dim layers.

---

## 📐 Project Structure

The project follows a layered architecture:

models/
├── staging/ # Raw-to-staging transformation
├── intermediate/ # Joins and key generation (e.g., int_dim_user)
├── core/ # Dimensions (e.g., dim_locations)
├── marts/
│ └── fact/ # Fact tables (e.g., fact_ride_participation)
└── schema.yml # Tests and documentation

---

## 📊 Key Models

### `fact_ride_participation`
Tracks each user's participation in a ride, enriched with role, join time, and location information.

**Fields include:**
- `user_key`, `user_id`
- `ride_id`, `is_creator`
- `role`, `join_time`, `ride_duration_seconds`
- `join_date_key` → joins to `dim_date`
- `exit_location_key` → joins to `dim_locations`

---

## 🧱 Dimensions
- **`dim_date`**: Standard calendar date dimension
- **`dim_locations`**: Surrogate-keyed location dimension based on exit lat/lng
- **`int_dim_user`**: Intermediate user dimension with generated surrogate keys

---
## Requirements
dbt-core >= 1.7
dbt-bigquery adapter
A profiles.yml file configured for your GCP project and BigQuery dataset

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
